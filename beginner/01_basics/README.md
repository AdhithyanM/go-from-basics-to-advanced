# Go Basics

This section covers the fundamental concepts of Go programming.

## Topics Covered

1. Hello World Program
2. Variables and Data Types
3. Constants
4. Type Inference
5. Zero Values
6. Type Conversion

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your system
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## Getting Started

### 1. Hello World Program

The traditional first program in any language. See `hello_world/main.go` for implementation.

### 2. Variables and Data Types

Go has several built-in data types:

- Basic types: int, float64, string, bool
- Complex types: complex64, complex128
- Derived types: arrays, slices, maps, structs, pointers

See `variables/main.go` for examples.

### 3. Constants

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword. See `constants/main.go` for examples.

### 4. Type Inference

Go can infer types based on the value assigned. See `type_inference/main.go` for examples.

### 5. Zero Values

Variables declared without an initial value get their zero value. See `zero_values/main.go` for examples.

### 6. Type Conversion

Go requires explicit type conversion. See `type_conversion/main.go` for examples.

## Exercises

1. Create a program that declares variables of different types
2. Write a program that demonstrates type conversion
3. Create a program that uses constants for mathematical calculations

## Running the Examples

To run any example, navigate to its directory and use:

```bash
cd hello_world  # or any other example directory
go run main.go
```

## Next Steps

After completing this section, move on to:

- Control Structures (if/else, loops)
- Functions
- Packages
