# Concurrency in Go

This section covers the fundamental concepts of concurrency in Go programming.

## Topics Covered

1. Goroutines

   - Basic goroutine creation
   - Goroutine synchronization
   - Goroutine communication
   - Goroutine lifecycle

2. Channels

   - Channel types (buffered/unbuffered)
   - Channel operations
   - Channel direction
   - Channel patterns

3. Select Statement

   - Basic select
   - Default case
   - Timeout handling
   - Multiple channel operations

4. WaitGroup

   - Basic usage
   - Multiple goroutines
   - Error handling

5. Mutex and RWMutex

   - Basic mutex usage
   - Read-write mutex
   - Lock/unlock patterns
   - Deadlock prevention

6. Atomic Operations
   - Atomic counters
   - Atomic boolean flags
   - Atomic value operations
