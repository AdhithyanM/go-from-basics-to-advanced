# Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Subsystem Classes**

   - Implement subsystem functionality
   - Handle work assigned by the Facade
   - Have no knowledge of the Facade

2. **Facade**

   - Knows which subsystem classes are responsible for a request
   - Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects
   - Provides a simplified interface to the subsystem

3. **Client**
   - Uses the Facade to interact with the subsystem
   - Doesn't need to know about the subsystem's complexity
   - Communicates with the subsystem through the Facade

### Implementation Features

- **Simplification**: Provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- **Decoupling**: Reduces coupling between subsystems and clients
- **Flexibility**: Subsystems can be changed without affecting clients
- **Encapsulation**: Hides subsystem complexity from clients

## Use Cases

1. **Complex Libraries**

   - Simplifying complex API usage
   - Providing a more convenient interface
   - Hiding implementation details

2. **Subsystem Integration**

   - Integrating multiple subsystems
   - Providing a unified interface
   - Managing subsystem dependencies

3. **Legacy Systems**
   - Wrapping legacy code
   - Modernizing old interfaces
   - Providing new functionality

## When to Use

- When you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem
- When there are many dependencies between clients and implementation classes
- When you want to layer your subsystems
- When you need to provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces

## When Not to Use

- When the subsystem is simple
- When you need to expose all subsystem functionality
- When the performance overhead is unacceptable
- When the subsystem is likely to change frequently

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the Facade focused and simple
   - Use composition to access subsystems
   - Make the Facade transparent to clients
   - Consider using the Adapter pattern for complex subsystems

2. **Testing**

   - Test subsystems independently
   - Test the Facade's interface
   - Test client interactions
   - Verify proper delegation

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the Facade's purpose
   - Explain the subsystem relationships
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a facade
facade := NewFacade("test")

// Create a client
client := NewClient(facade)

// Use the facade through the client
result := client.UseFacade()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Making the Facade too complex
   - Exposing too much subsystem detail
   - Creating too many Facades

2. **Performance**

   - Additional indirection overhead
   - Unnecessary subsystem initialization
   - Inefficient delegation

3. **Maintenance**
   - Difficulty in modifying subsystems
   - Complex dependency management
   - Hard to extend functionality

## Related Patterns

- **Adapter**: Changes an interface to match another
- **Mediator**: Coordinates communication between objects
- **Proxy**: Controls access to an object
