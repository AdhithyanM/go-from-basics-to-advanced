# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Target**

   - Defines the domain-specific interface that Client uses
   - Represents the interface that the client expects

2. **Adaptee**

   - Contains some useful behavior but has an incompatible interface
   - Represents the existing class that needs to be adapted

3. **Adapter**

   - Makes the Adaptee's interface compatible with the Target's interface
   - Wraps the Adaptee and implements the Target interface

4. **Client**
   - Collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface
   - Uses the Target interface without knowing the concrete implementation

### Implementation Features

- **Interface Compatibility**: Enables communication between incompatible interfaces
- **Reusability**: Allows reuse of existing classes with different interfaces
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new adapters for different adaptees
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the details of adaptation from the client

## Use Cases

1. **Legacy Code Integration**

   - Integrating legacy systems with new code
   - Adapting third-party libraries
   - Working with incompatible interfaces

2. **Interface Standardization**

   - Creating consistent interfaces across different implementations
   - Providing a unified interface for similar functionality
   - Simplifying client code

3. **Testing**
   - Creating test adapters for mocking
   - Adapting real objects for testing
   - Isolating components for testing

## When to Use

- When you want to use an existing class, but its interface doesn't match what you need
- When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated classes
- When you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing

## When Not to Use

- When the interfaces are already compatible
- When the adaptation would be too complex
- When there's a better way to achieve the same result

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the adapter focused on a single responsibility
   - Make the adapter transparent to the client
   - Consider using object composition over inheritance

2. **Testing**

   - Test both the adapter and the adaptee
   - Verify interface compatibility
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the purpose of the adapter
   - Explain the relationship between interfaces
   - Provide usage examples

## Example Usage

```go
// Create an Adaptee
adaptee := NewAdaptee("specific request")

// Create an Adapter
adapter := NewAdapter(adaptee)

// Use the Target interface
client := &Client{}
result := client.UseTarget(adapter)
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overuse**

   - Creating unnecessary adapters
   - Adding too many layers of adaptation
   - Making the code more complex than needed

2. **Performance**

   - Additional indirection overhead
   - Memory usage from adapter objects
   - Complex adaptation logic

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keeping adapters in sync with changes
   - Managing multiple adapters
   - Documenting adapter relationships

## Related Patterns

- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object
