# Composite Pattern

The Composite pattern composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Component**

   - Defines the interface for objects in the composition
   - Declares operations that are common to both simple and complex objects
   - May implement default behavior for common operations

2. **Leaf**

   - Represents leaf objects in the composition
   - Implements the Component interface
   - Defines behavior for primitive objects

3. **Composite**
   - Defines behavior for components having children
   - Stores child components
   - Implements child-related operations in the Component interface

### Implementation Features

- **Uniformity**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Recursive Composition**: Allows for recursive tree structures
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new kinds of components
- **Transparency**: Clients don't need to know if they're dealing with a leaf or composite

## Use Cases

1. **GUI Components**

   - Windows containing panels containing buttons
   - Menus containing menu items
   - Tree views with nodes

2. **File Systems**

   - Directories containing files and subdirectories
   - File system navigation
   - File operations

3. **Organization Structures**
   - Company departments
   - Organizational charts
   - Team hierarchies

## When to Use

- When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies
- When you want clients to ignore the difference between compositions and individual objects
- When the structure can have any level of complexity and is dynamic
- When you want to treat all objects in the structure uniformly

## When Not to Use

- When the structure is simple and unlikely to change
- When the performance overhead of the pattern is unacceptable
- When the differences between individual and composite objects are significant
- When the structure is flat and doesn't need hierarchy

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the Component interface simple
   - Implement default behavior in the Component interface
   - Use transparent composition when possible
   - Consider using the Flyweight pattern for leaf nodes

2. **Testing**

   - Test individual components
   - Test composite structures
   - Test operations at different levels
   - Verify proper handling of leaf and composite nodes

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the component hierarchy
   - Explain the composition rules
   - Provide examples of common operations
   - Document any limitations or constraints

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a composite structure
root := NewComposite("Root")
branch := NewComposite("Branch")
leaf1 := NewLeaf("A")
leaf2 := NewLeaf("B")

// Build the tree
branch.Add(leaf1)
branch.Add(leaf2)
root.Add(branch)

// Perform operations
result := root.Operation()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex component interfaces
   - Unnecessary operations in the interface
   - Too many levels of nesting

2. **Performance**

   - Inefficient traversal of large structures
   - Memory overhead from composite objects
   - Costly operations on deep structures

3. **Maintenance**
   - Difficulty in adding new operations
   - Complex state management
   - Hard to debug deep structures

## Related Patterns

- **Decorator**: Often used with Composite to add responsibilities to components
- **Iterator**: Used to traverse composite structures
- **Visitor**: Used to perform operations on composite structures
