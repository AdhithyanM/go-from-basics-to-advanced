# Flyweight Pattern

The Flyweight pattern uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. It reduces memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **FlyweightFactory**

   - Creates and manages flyweight objects
   - Ensures flyweights are shared properly
   - Maintains a pool of existing flyweights

2. **ConcreteFlyweight**

   - Implements the flyweight interface
   - Stores intrinsic state
   - Must be sharable
   - Any state it stores must be intrinsic

3. **UnsharedConcreteFlyweight**

   - Not all flyweight subclasses need to be shared
   - The unshared concrete flyweight objects typically have their children as flyweights

4. **Client**
   - Maintains references to flyweights
   - Computes or stores extrinsic state
   - Uses the FlyweightFactory to get flyweight objects

### Implementation Features

- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common data
- **Performance**: Improves performance by reducing object creation
- **Thread Safety**: Uses synchronization to ensure thread safety
- **Flexibility**: Supports both shared and unshared objects

## Use Cases

1. **Text Processing**

   - Character formatting in word processors
   - Document rendering
   - Text layout

2. **Graphics**

   - Rendering large numbers of similar objects
   - Game development
   - UI components

3. **Data Structures**
   - Tree structures with many similar nodes
   - Graph representations
   - Symbol tables

## When to Use

- When an application uses a large number of objects
- When storage costs are high due to the quantity of objects
- When most object state can be made extrinsic
- When many groups of objects may be replaced by relatively few shared objects

## When Not to Use

- When the objects are not similar enough to share
- When the extrinsic state is too large
- When the overhead of managing the flyweights exceeds the savings
- When the application doesn't use enough objects to make sharing worthwhile

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the flyweight interface simple
   - Make flyweight objects immutable
   - Use thread-safe factory methods
   - Consider using the Singleton pattern for the factory

2. **Testing**

   - Test object sharing
   - Test thread safety
   - Test memory usage
   - Verify proper state management

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the sharing strategy
   - Explain the state separation
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document thread safety guarantees

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a factory
factory := NewFlyweightFactory()

// Create a client
client := NewClient(factory)

// Use shared flyweight
result1 := client.UseFlyweight("shared", "unique1")

// Use unshared flyweight
result2 := client.UseUnsharedFlyweight("all")
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex state management
   - Difficult to maintain extrinsic state
   - Complex synchronization requirements

2. **Performance**

   - High overhead for small numbers of objects
   - Costly extrinsic state computation
   - Synchronization overhead

3. **Maintenance**
   - Hard to debug shared state
   - Difficult to modify shared objects
   - Complex memory management

## Related Patterns

- **Composite**: Flyweights can be used to implement shared leaf nodes
- **State**: Can be used to implement state objects as flyweights
- **Strategy**: Can be used to implement strategy objects as flyweights
