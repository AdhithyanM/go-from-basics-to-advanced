# Bridge Pattern

The Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Abstraction**

   - Defines the abstraction's interface
   - Maintains a reference to an Implementor
   - May extend the interface with refined abstractions

2. **Refined Abstraction**

   - Extends the abstraction interface
   - Provides additional functionality
   - Uses the Implementor to perform operations

3. **Implementor**

   - Defines the interface for implementation classes
   - Provides primitive operations
   - Can be extended with concrete implementations

4. **Concrete Implementor**
   - Implements the Implementor interface
   - Provides concrete implementations of operations
   - Can be changed without affecting the abstraction

### Implementation Features

- **Decoupling**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new abstractions and implementations
- **Flexibility**: Implementation can be changed at runtime
- **Encapsulation**: Hides implementation details from clients

## Use Cases

1. **Platform Independence**

   - Supporting multiple operating systems
   - Handling different database systems
   - Working with various UI frameworks

2. **Feature Variation**

   - Different implementations of the same feature
   - Multiple ways to perform an operation
   - Alternative algorithms or strategies

3. **Testing**
   - Mocking implementations for testing
   - Providing test implementations
   - Isolating components for testing

## When to Use

- When you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation
- When both abstractions and implementations should be extensible
- When changes in implementation should not affect clients
- When you want to hide implementation details from clients

## When Not to Use

- When the abstraction and implementation are tightly coupled
- When the implementation is unlikely to change
- When the performance overhead is unacceptable
- When the abstraction is simple and unlikely to change

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the bridge focused and simple
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Make the bridge transparent to clients

2. **Testing**

   - Test abstractions and implementations separately
   - Verify bridge functionality
   - Test with different combinations

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the bridge's purpose
   - Explain the relationship between components
   - Provide usage examples

## Example Usage

```go
// Create an implementor
implementor := &ConcreteImplementorA{}

// Create an abstraction
abstraction := NewRefinedAbstraction(implementor)

// Use the abstraction
client := &Client{}
result := client.UseAbstraction(abstraction)
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Creating unnecessary bridges
   - Making the bridge too complex
   - Adding too many layers

2. **Performance**

   - Additional indirection overhead
   - Memory usage from bridge objects
   - Complex method calls

3. **Maintenance**
   - Keeping abstractions and implementations in sync
   - Managing multiple implementations
   - Documenting bridge relationships

- **Adapter**: Makes unrelated classes work together
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms
- **State**: Encapsulates state-dependent behavior
