# Proxy Pattern

The Proxy pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It adds a level of indirection to support distributed, controlled, or intelligent access.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Subject**

   - Defines the common interface for RealSubject and Proxy
   - Declares the operations that can be performed on the RealSubject

2. **RealSubject**

   - Defines the real object that the proxy represents
   - Implements the Subject interface
   - Performs the actual operations

3. **Proxy**

   - Maintains a reference to the RealSubject
   - Controls access to the RealSubject
   - Implements the Subject interface
   - Can perform additional operations before or after forwarding requests

4. **Client**
   - Uses the Subject interface
   - Doesn't need to know if it's dealing with a RealSubject or Proxy

### Implementation Features

- **Access Control**: Controls access to the RealSubject
- **Caching**: Implements caching for expensive operations
- **Lazy Initialization**: Delays creation of expensive objects
- **Thread Safety**: Ensures thread-safe access to shared resources

## Use Cases

1. **Remote Proxies**

   - Represent objects in different address spaces
   - Handle network communication
   - Manage remote object lifecycle

2. **Virtual Proxies**

   - Create expensive objects on demand
   - Cache results of expensive operations
   - Manage resource-intensive objects

3. **Protection Proxies**
   - Control access to sensitive objects
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Enforce security policies

## When to Use

- When you need a more sophisticated reference to an object
- When you want to add functionality to an object without changing its interface
- When you need to control access to an object
- When you want to add caching or lazy initialization

## When Not to Use

- When the overhead of the proxy is unacceptable
- When the RealSubject is simple and doesn't need additional functionality
- When the client can directly access the RealSubject
- When the proxy would add unnecessary complexity

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the proxy interface identical to the RealSubject
   - Make the proxy transparent to the client
   - Use composition to access the RealSubject
   - Consider using the Decorator pattern for additional functionality

2. **Testing**

   - Test the proxy's access control
   - Test caching behavior
   - Test error handling
   - Verify proper delegation

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the proxy's purpose
   - Explain the access control rules
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a real subject
realSubject := NewRealSubject("test")

// Create a proxy
proxy := NewProxy(realSubject, time.Second)

// Create a client
client := NewClient(proxy)

// Use the proxy through the client
result := client.UseSubject()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex proxy implementations
   - Unnecessary proxy layers
   - Complex state management

2. **Performance**

   - Additional indirection overhead
   - Inefficient caching
   - Unnecessary object creation

3. **Maintenance**
   - Difficulty in keeping proxy and RealSubject in sync
   - Complex error handling
   - Hard to debug proxy behavior

## Related Patterns

- **Adapter**: Changes an object's interface
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
