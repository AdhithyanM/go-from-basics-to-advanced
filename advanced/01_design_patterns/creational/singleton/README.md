# Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

## Description

The Singleton pattern is a creational pattern that:

- Ensures only one instance of a class exists
- Provides global access to that instance
- Lazy initializes the instance when first needed
- Ensures thread-safe access to the instance

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Singleton Struct**

   ```go
   type Singleton struct {
       data map[string]interface{}
       mu   sync.RWMutex
   }
   ```

   - `data`: Stores key-value pairs
   - `mu`: Ensures thread-safe access to data

2. **Instance Management**

   ```go
   var (
       instance *Singleton
       once     sync.Once
   )
   ```

   - `instance`: Holds the single instance
   - `once`: Ensures thread-safe initialization

3. **Thread-Safe Methods**
   - `Set`: Uses write lock for updates
   - `Get`: Uses read lock for reads
   - `Delete`: Uses write lock for deletions
   - `Clear`: Uses write lock for clearing

### Thread Safety

The implementation ensures thread safety through:

1. `sync.Once` for initialization
2. `sync.RWMutex` for data access
3. Proper locking/unlocking patterns
4. Concurrent access handling

## Use Cases

1. **Configuration Management**

   - Database connections
   - Application settings
   - Logging systems
   - Cache managers

2. **Resource Management**

   - Thread pools
   - Connection pools
   - File system handlers
   - Device managers

3. **State Management**
   - Global state
   - Application state
   - Session management
   - Cache state

## When to Use

1. **Single Instance Requirement**

   - When exactly one instance is needed
   - When that instance needs to be shared
   - When the instance needs to be controlled

2. **Resource Intensive Objects**

   - When creating multiple instances is expensive
   - When instances share common resources
   - When instances need to coordinate

3. **Global State Management**
   - When global state needs to be maintained
   - When state needs to be synchronized
   - When state needs to be accessed globally

## When Not to Use

1. **Multiple Instances Needed**

   - When different configurations are required
   - When instances need different states
   - When instances need to be independent

2. **Testability Concerns**

   - When unit testing is critical
   - When mocking is required
   - When dependency injection is preferred

3. **Concurrency Issues**
   - When thread safety is critical
   - When multiple threads need different states
   - When synchronization overhead is unacceptable

## Best Practices

1. **Thread Safety**

   - Use `sync.Once` for initialization
   - Implement proper locking
   - Consider concurrent access patterns

2. **Testing**

   - Make singleton testable
   - Allow dependency injection
   - Provide reset mechanisms

3. **Documentation**
   - Document thread safety guarantees
   - Explain initialization behavior
   - Provide usage examples

## Example Usage

```go
// Get the singleton instance
instance := GetInstance()

// Set some data
instance.Set("key", "value")

// Get the data
value, exists := instance.Get("key")

// Delete data
instance.Delete("key")

// Clear all data
instance.Clear()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Race detection:

```bash
go test -race
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Thread Safety Issues**

   - Race conditions
   - Deadlocks
   - Performance bottlenecks

2. **Testing Difficulties**

   - Hard to mock
   - State persistence between tests
   - Dependency injection issues

3. **Global State Problems**
   - Hidden dependencies
   - Tight coupling
   - Hard to reason about state

## Related Patterns

1. **Factory Method**

   - Can be used to create singleton instances
   - Provides more flexibility in instance creation

2. **Abstract Factory**

   - Can manage multiple singleton instances
   - Provides interface for creating families of objects

3. **State**
   - Can be used to manage singleton state
   - Provides state transitions
