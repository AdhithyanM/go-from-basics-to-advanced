# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Product Interface**

   - Defines the interface for the objects that the factory method creates
   - Includes methods that all concrete products must implement

2. **Concrete Products**

   - Implement the Product interface
   - Represent different types of objects that can be created

3. **Creator Interface**

   - Declares the factory method that returns new product objects
   - May include default implementation of some operations

4. **Concrete Creators**
   - Override the factory method to return different types of products
   - Each creator is responsible for creating a specific type of product

### Implementation Features

- **Type Safety**: The factory method ensures that the correct type of product is created
- **Extensibility**: New product types can be added without modifying existing code
- **Encapsulation**: Product creation logic is encapsulated in creator classes
- **Polymorphism**: Clients can work with products through their interface

## Use Cases

1. **Framework Development**

   - When a framework needs to delegate object creation to subclasses
   - When the exact type of objects to create is determined by subclasses

2. **Plugin Systems**

   - When the system needs to work with different implementations of an interface
   - When new implementations can be added without modifying existing code

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - When object creation needs to be delegated to specialized factories
   - When the creation process is complex or requires specific configuration

## When to Use

- When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
- When classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses

## When Not to Use

- When the creation process is simple and straightforward
- When there's only one type of product to create
- When the factory method would add unnecessary complexity

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Make the factory method abstract to force subclasses to implement it
   - Use meaningful names for factory methods
   - Consider using parameterized factory methods for flexibility

2. **Testing**

   - Test each concrete creator and product combination
   - Verify that the correct type of product is created
   - Test error cases and edge conditions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the purpose of each creator and product
   - Explain the relationships between creators and products
   - Provide examples of how to extend the pattern

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a specific creator
creator := NewCreator("A")

// Use the creator to create and work with products
result := creator.SomeOperation("ProductA")
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overuse**

   - Using factory methods when simple constructors would suffice
   - Creating too many product types and creators

2. **Complexity**

   - Making the factory method too complex
   - Adding unnecessary parameters to factory methods

3. **Maintenance**
   - Not keeping creators and products in sync
   - Failing to document the relationships between creators and products

## Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Often implemented using factory methods
- **Template Method**: Factory method is a specialization of template method
- **Prototype**: Can be used as an alternative to factory method
