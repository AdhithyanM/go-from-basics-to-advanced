# Prototype Pattern

The Prototype pattern specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Prototype Interface**

   - Declares the cloning method
   - Defines common operations for all prototypes

2. **Concrete Prototypes**

   - Implement the Prototype interface
   - Provide specific cloning implementations
   - Handle deep copying of complex data structures

3. **Prototype Registry**
   - Manages a collection of prototypes
   - Provides methods to add, get, and remove prototypes
   - Handles prototype lifecycle

### Implementation Features

- **Deep Copying**: Ensures complete independence of cloned objects
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new prototype types
- **Performance**: Avoids expensive object creation
- **Encapsulation**: Hides cloning details from clients

## Use Cases

1. **Object Pooling**

   - Reusing expensive objects
   - Managing object lifecycle
   - Reducing memory allocation

2. **Configuration Management**

   - Creating default configurations
   - Customizing configurations
   - Managing configuration templates

3. **Game Development**
   - Creating game objects
   - Managing object templates
   - Optimizing object creation

## When to Use

- When the classes to instantiate are specified at runtime
- When you want to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories
- When instances of a class can have only a few different combinations of state
- When object creation is expensive compared to cloning

## When Not to Use

- When objects have circular references
- When deep copying is too expensive
- When objects have complex initialization
- When there are only a few object variations

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Implement proper deep copying
   - Handle circular references
   - Consider shallow vs. deep copy trade-offs

2. **Testing**

   - Test cloning correctness
   - Verify independence of clones
   - Check memory usage

3. **Documentation**
   - Document cloning behavior
   - Explain prototype relationships
   - Provide usage examples

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a prototype
prototype := NewConcretePrototype1("test")
prototype.SetData("key", "value")

// Clone the prototype
clone := prototype.Clone().(*ConcretePrototype1)

// Use the clone
info := clone.GetInfo()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Shallow Copying**

   - Not properly copying nested objects
   - Sharing references between clones
   - Unexpected side effects

2. **Memory Management**

   - Memory leaks from improper cloning
   - Excessive memory usage
   - Poor garbage collection

3. **Performance**
   - Expensive deep copying
   - Unnecessary object creation
   - Complex cloning logic

## Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Can use prototypes to create objects
- **Composite**: Prototypes often contain composite objects
- **Singleton**: Can be used to manage prototype instances
