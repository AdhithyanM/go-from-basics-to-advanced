# Abstract Factory Pattern

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Abstract Products**

   - Define interfaces for a family of products
   - Each product interface declares operations that all concrete products must implement

2. **Concrete Products**

   - Implement the abstract product interfaces
   - Each concrete product belongs to a specific family

3. **Abstract Factory**

   - Declares a set of methods for creating each abstract product
   - Each method returns an abstract product type

4. **Concrete Factories**
   - Implement the abstract factory interface
   - Each concrete factory creates products of a specific family

### Implementation Features

- **Family Consistency**: Ensures that products created by a factory are compatible
- **Encapsulation**: Hides the concrete product classes from the client
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new product families
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time checking of product compatibility

## Use Cases

1. **UI Framework Development**

   - Creating families of UI components for different platforms
   - Ensuring consistent look and feel across components

2. **Database Access**

   - Supporting multiple database vendors
   - Creating compatible database objects (connections, statements, etc.)

3. **Game Development**
   - Creating different themes or styles of game objects
   - Ensuring visual consistency within a theme

## When to Use

- When a system needs to be independent of how its products are created
- When a system needs to work with multiple families of products
- When products in a family need to be used together
- When you want to provide a class library of products

## When Not to Use

- When the product families are not well-defined
- When the system needs to work with a single family of products
- When the creation process is simple and straightforward

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Define clear interfaces for products and factories
   - Ensure products within a family are compatible
   - Use meaningful names for product families

2. **Testing**

   - Test each factory and product combination
   - Verify family consistency
   - Test error cases and edge conditions

3. **Documentation**
   - Document product family relationships
   - Explain factory responsibilities
   - Provide examples of product usage

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a specific factory
factory := NewFactory("1")

// Create and use products from the factory
productA := factory.CreateProductA()
productB := factory.CreateProductB()

// Use the products
resultA := productA.OperationA()
resultB := productB.InteractWithA(productA)
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Creating too many product families
   - Making the factory interface too complex
   - Adding unnecessary abstraction layers

2. **Maintenance**

   - Not keeping product families in sync
   - Failing to document family relationships
   - Adding new products without updating all factories

3. **Performance**
   - Unnecessary object creation
   - Complex factory initialization
   - Memory overhead from abstraction

- **Factory Method**: Often used to implement abstract factories
- **Singleton**: Abstract factories are often implemented as singletons
- **Prototype**: Can be used to create new product instances
