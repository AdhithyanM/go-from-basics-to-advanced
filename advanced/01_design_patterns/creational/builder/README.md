# Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Product**

   - Represents the complex object being built
   - Contains all parts that make up the object
   - Provides methods to access its parts

2. **Builder Interface**

   - Specifies methods for creating parts of the Product
   - Defines the steps to build the product
   - Provides a method to get the final product

3. **Concrete Builders**

   - Implement the Builder interface
   - Provide specific implementations for building parts
   - Keep track of the product being built

4. **Director**
   - Controls the construction process
   - Uses the Builder interface to build products
   - Can work with any concrete builder

### Implementation Features

- **Step-by-Step Construction**: Products are built part by part
- **Different Representations**: Same construction process can create different products
- **Encapsulation**: Construction details are hidden from the client
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new builders and products

## Use Cases

1. **Document Builders**

   - Creating different document formats (PDF, HTML, etc.)
   - Building complex documents with multiple parts

2. **UI Component Builders**

   - Creating complex UI components
   - Building different styles of components

3. **Query Builders**
   - Constructing database queries
   - Building different types of queries

## When to Use

- When the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts
- When the construction process must allow different representations
- When you need to create objects with many optional components
- When you want to provide a clear API for constructing objects

## When Not to Use

- When the object being built is simple
- When the construction process is straightforward
- When there's only one way to build the object

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Make the Builder interface clear and focused
   - Keep the construction process simple
   - Use meaningful names for builder methods

2. **Testing**

   - Test each builder separately
   - Verify the construction process
   - Test different product configurations

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the construction process
   - Explain builder responsibilities
   - Provide examples of product building

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a builder
builder := NewConcreteBuilder1()

// Create a director with the builder
director := NewDirector(builder)

// Construct the product
product := director.Construct()

// Use the product
partA := product.GetPartA()
partB := product.GetPartB()
partC := product.GetPartC()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Making the builder interface too complex
   - Adding too many optional parts
   - Creating unnecessary abstraction layers

2. **Maintenance**

   - Not keeping builders in sync
   - Failing to document construction steps
   - Adding new parts without updating all builders

3. **Performance**
   - Unnecessary object creation
   - Complex construction process
   - Memory overhead from intermediate objects

## Related Patterns

- **Abstract Factory**: Can be used to create families of builders
- **Composite**: Builders often create composite objects
- **Prototype**: Can be used to create new product instances
