# Chain of Responsibility Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows an object to send a request without knowing which object will handle it. The request is passed along a chain of handlers until one of them handles it.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Handler**

   - Defines the interface for handling requests
   - Declares the method for setting the next handler
   - Declares the method for handling requests

2. **BaseHandler**

   - Provides default implementation for Handler
   - Maintains a reference to the next handler
   - Implements the chain traversal logic

3. **Concrete Handlers**

   - Implement the Handler interface
   - Handle requests they are responsible for
   - Pass requests to the next handler if they can't handle them

4. **Client**
   - Initiates requests to the chain
   - Doesn't need to know which handler will process the request

### Implementation Features

- **Decoupling**: Sender and receiver are decoupled
- **Flexibility**: Handlers can be added or removed dynamically
- **Single Responsibility**: Each handler has a single responsibility
- **Ordering**: Handlers can be ordered in a specific sequence

## Use Cases

1. **Request Processing**

   - Multiple handlers can process a request
   - Each handler can handle a specific type of request
   - Handlers can be added or removed without changing the client

2. **Event Handling**

   - Events can be handled by multiple handlers
   - Handlers can be registered dynamically
   - Events can be filtered or transformed

3. **Middleware**
   - Multiple middleware components can process requests
   - Each middleware can add functionality
   - Middleware can be composed in different ways

## When to Use

- When multiple objects can handle a request
- When you want to decouple the sender and receiver
- When you want to add or remove handlers dynamically
- When you want to specify handlers at runtime

## When Not to Use

- When the request must be handled by a specific handler
- When the chain is too long or complex
- When the overhead of the chain is unacceptable
- When the handlers need to know about each other

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep handlers simple and focused
   - Use composition to build the chain
   - Make the chain traversal efficient
   - Consider using the Command pattern for requests

2. **Testing**

   - Test each handler independently
   - Test the chain as a whole
   - Test error handling
   - Test dynamic chain modification

3. **Documentation**
   - Document the chain structure
   - Explain the handler responsibilities
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create handlers
handlerA := NewConcreteHandlerA()
handlerB := NewConcreteHandlerB()
handlerC := NewConcreteHandlerC()

// Build the chain
handlerA.SetNext(handlerB).SetNext(handlerC)

// Create client
client := NewClient(handlerA)

// Send request
result := client.SendRequest("B")
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex handlers
   - Long chains
   - Complex state management

2. **Performance**

   - Inefficient chain traversal
   - Unnecessary handler calls
   - Memory overhead

3. **Maintenance**
   - Difficulty in debugging
   - Hard to understand chain behavior
   - Complex error handling

## Related Patterns

- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
