# Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Command**

   - Defines the interface for executing commands
   - Declares methods for executing and undoing commands
   - Encapsulates the request and its parameters

2. **Receiver**

   - Knows how to perform the operations
   - Contains the actual business logic
   - Maintains the state affected by commands

3. **Concrete Commands**

   - Implement the Command interface
   - Define a binding between a Receiver and an action
   - Implement Execute and Undo methods

4. **Invoker**

   - Asks the command to carry out the request
   - Maintains a history of executed commands
   - Provides undo functionality

5. **Client**
   - Creates a ConcreteCommand and sets its Receiver
   - Configures the Invoker with the command
   - Initiates command execution

### Implementation Features

- **Encapsulation**: Commands encapsulate requests
- **Undo/Redo**: Support for undoable operations
- **Queueing**: Commands can be queued and executed later
- **Logging**: Command history can be maintained
- **Decoupling**: Invoker is decoupled from Receiver

## Use Cases

1. **GUI Operations**

   - Menu items and buttons
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Macro recording and playback

2. **Transaction Management**

   - Database transactions
   - File operations
   - Network requests

3. **Workflow Systems**
   - Task scheduling
   - Job queues
   - Batch processing

## When to Use

- When you need to parameterize objects with operations
- When you need to queue operations
- When you need to support undo/redo
- When you need to log operations
- When you need to decouple the invoker from the receiver

## When Not to Use

- When operations are simple and don't need encapsulation
- When undo/redo is not required
- When performance is critical
- When the overhead of command objects is unacceptable

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep commands simple and focused
   - Use composition to build complex commands
   - Make commands immutable
   - Consider using the Memento pattern for undo

2. **Testing**

   - Test each command independently
   - Test command sequences
   - Test undo/redo functionality
   - Test error handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Document command parameters
   - Explain undo behavior
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create client
client := NewClient()

// Execute command
result := client.RunCommand("test")

// Undo command
client.UndoLastCommand()
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex commands
   - Deep command hierarchies
   - Complex undo logic

2. **Performance**

   - Command object overhead
   - Memory usage for command history
   - Undo/redo performance

3. **Maintenance**
   - Command proliferation
   - State management
   - Error handling

## Related Patterns

- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state
- **Composite**: Treats individual objects and compositions uniformly
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers
