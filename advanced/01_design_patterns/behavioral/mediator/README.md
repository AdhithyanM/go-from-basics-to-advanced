# Mediator Pattern

The Mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Mediator**

   - Defines the interface for communication between colleagues
   - Coordinates communication between colleague objects
   - Maintains references to colleagues

2. **Colleague**

   - Defines the interface for objects that communicate through the mediator
   - Maintains a reference to the mediator
   - Communicates with other colleagues through the mediator

3. **ConcreteMediator**

   - Implements the Mediator interface
   - Coordinates communication between colleagues
   - Knows and maintains its colleagues

4. **ConcreteColleague**
   - Implements the Colleague interface
   - Communicates with other colleagues through the mediator
   - Has a reference to the mediator

### Implementation Features

- **Decoupling**: Colleagues are decoupled from each other
- **Centralized Control**: Communication logic is centralized
- **Simplified Communication**: Complex communication patterns are simplified
- **Flexibility**: Communication patterns can be changed independently

## Use Cases

1. **GUI Components**

   - Dialog boxes
   - Form validation
   - Component coordination

2. **Distributed Systems**

   - Message routing
   - Service coordination
   - Event handling

3. **Game Development**
   - Character interaction
   - Game state management
   - Event propagation

## When to Use

- When a set of objects communicate in complex ways
- When you want to reduce dependencies between objects
- When you want to centralize communication logic
- When you want to make communication patterns more flexible

## When Not to Use

- When communication patterns are simple
- When performance is critical
- When objects are tightly coupled
- When the mediator becomes too complex

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep the mediator simple
   - Avoid making the mediator a god object
   - Use interfaces for flexibility
   - Consider using the Observer pattern for notification

2. **Testing**

   - Test each colleague independently
   - Test communication patterns
   - Test mediator coordination
   - Test error handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Document communication patterns
   - Explain mediator responsibilities
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create client
client := NewClient()

// Create colleagues
colleagueA := NewConcreteColleagueA("A")
colleagueB := NewConcreteColleagueB("B")

// Add colleagues to client
client.AddColleague("A", colleagueA)
client.AddColleague("B", colleagueB)

// Send message
client.SendMessage(colleagueA, "test")
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex mediator
   - Complex communication patterns
   - State management issues

2. **Performance**

   - Mediator overhead
   - Communication latency
   - Memory usage

3. **Maintenance**
   - Difficult to debug
   - Hard to understand communication flow
   - Error handling complexity

## Related Patterns

- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
