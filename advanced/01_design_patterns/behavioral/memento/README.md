# Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Originator**

   - Creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current state
   - Uses the memento to restore its state
   - Maintains the current state

2. **Memento**

   - Stores the internal state of the Originator
   - Protects against access by objects other than the Originator
   - Provides methods to retrieve the stored state

3. **Caretaker**

   - Is responsible for the memento's safekeeping
   - Never operates on or examines the contents of a memento
   - Maintains a history of mementos

### Implementation Features

- **Encapsulation**: Preserves encapsulation boundaries
- **State Management**: Provides state restoration capabilities
- **History**: Maintains a history of states
- **Undo/Redo**: Enables undo/redo functionality

## Use Cases

1. **Undo/Redo Operations**

   - Text editors
   - Graphic editors
   - Database transactions

2. **State Management**

   - Game state saving
   - Configuration management
   - Session management

3. **Checkpointing**
   - System recovery
   - Process state saving
   - Error recovery

## When to Use

- When you need to save and restore an object's state
- When you need to implement undo/redo functionality
- When you want to maintain encapsulation
- When you need to maintain a history of states

## When Not to Use

- When the state is simple and doesn't need encapsulation
- When performance is critical
- When memory usage is a concern
- When the state changes frequently

## Best Practices

1. **Implementation**

   - Keep mementos small and focused
   - Use interfaces for flexibility
   - Consider using the Command pattern for undo/redo
   - Handle state serialization carefully

2. **Testing**

   - Test state saving and restoration
   - Test undo/redo functionality
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error handling

3. **Documentation**
   - Document state structure
   - Explain undo/redo behavior
   - Provide usage examples
   - Document any limitations

## Example Usage

```go
// Create client with initial state
client := NewClient("initial")

// Save current state
client.SaveState()

// Change state
client.SetState("new")

// Save new state
client.SaveState()

// Restore to previous state
client.RestoreState(0)
```

## Testing

Run the tests with:

```bash
go test -v
```

Check test coverage:

```bash
go test -cover
```

Run benchmarks:

```bash
go test -bench=.
```

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Complexity**

   - Overly complex state management
   - Complex undo/redo logic
   - State serialization issues

2. **Performance**

   - Memory usage for state history
   - State serialization overhead
   - State restoration time

3. **Maintenance**
   - State versioning
   - State compatibility
   - Error handling

## Related Patterns

- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones
