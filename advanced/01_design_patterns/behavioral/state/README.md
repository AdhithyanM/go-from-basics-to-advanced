# State Pattern

The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.

## Key Components

- **State**: Interface that defines the behavior associated with a particular state
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to the current state and delegates state-specific behavior
- **ConcreteState**: Implements the State interface and provides state-specific behavior
- **Client**: Uses the Context to interact with the state machine

## Implementation Features

- Clean separation of state-specific behavior
- Easy addition of new states
- Simplified state transitions
- Encapsulated state logic
- Type-safe state management

## Use Cases

- Object behavior depends on its state
- Complex conditional statements in object's methods
- State-specific behavior changes frequently
- State transitions need to be explicit
- Multiple objects share similar state-dependent behavior

## When to Use

- When an object's behavior depends on its state
- When you have many conditional statements that depend on the object's state
- When you need to add new states without modifying existing code
- When you want to make state transitions explicit
- When you need to share state behavior between multiple objects

## When Not to Use

- When state transitions are simple and infrequent
- When the number of states is small and fixed
- When state-specific behavior is minimal
- When performance is critical
- When the state pattern would add unnecessary complexity

## Best Practices

1. **State Interface Design**

   - Keep the state interface focused
   - Define clear state transition methods
   - Make state methods self-contained
   - Consider using the Strategy pattern for state behavior

2. **Context Management**

   - Keep context simple and focused
   - Delegate state-specific behavior to states
   - Make state transitions explicit
   - Consider using the Flyweight pattern for state objects

3. **State Transitions**

   - Make transitions explicit
   - Document transition rules
   - Handle invalid transitions gracefully
   - Consider using the Memento pattern for state history

4. **Testing**
   - Test each state independently
   - Test state transitions
   - Test edge cases
   - Test concurrent state changes

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a client with initial state
client := NewClient(NewConcreteStateA())

// Make requests that trigger state transitions
result := client.MakeRequest()
// State transitions from A to B

result = client.MakeRequest()
// State transitions from B to A
```

## Testing

Run the tests using:

```bash
go test -v
```

The test suite includes:

- Testing individual state behavior
- Testing state transitions
- Testing context management
- Testing client usage
- Testing edge cases

## Common Pitfalls

1. **State Explosion**

   - Too many states
   - Complex state transitions
   - Difficult to maintain
   - Hard to test

2. **State Management**

   - Unclear state transitions
   - Invalid state transitions
   - State synchronization issues
   - Memory leaks

3. **Performance**

   - State object creation overhead
   - Frequent state transitions
   - Complex state logic
   - Memory usage

4. **Maintenance**
   - Hard to add new states
   - Difficult to modify existing states
   - Complex state dependencies
   - Poor documentation

## Related Patterns

- **Strategy**: Encapsulates algorithms in separate classes
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state
- **Flyweight**: Shares state objects to reduce memory usage
- **Singleton**: Ensures a state object is unique
- **Observer**: Notifies interested objects of state changes
