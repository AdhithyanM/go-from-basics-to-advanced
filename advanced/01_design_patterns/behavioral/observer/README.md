# Observer Pattern

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## Key Components

- **Subject**: Interface that defines methods for registering, removing, and notifying observers
- **ConcreteSubject**: Implements the Subject interface and maintains the state
- **Observer**: Interface that defines the update method for observers
- **ConcreteObserver**: Implements the Observer interface and maintains its own state
- **Client**: Uses the Subject and Observer interfaces to implement the pattern

## Implementation Features

- Thread-safe observer management
- Support for multiple observer types
- Flexible registration and removal of observers
- Automatic notification of state changes
- Clean separation of concerns between subject and observers

## Use Cases

- Event handling systems
- GUI frameworks
- Publish-subscribe systems
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
- Real-time data updates
- Stock market monitoring
- Weather monitoring systems

## When to Use

- When changes to one object require changes to other objects
- When the number of objects that need to be notified is unknown or dynamic
- When you want to maintain loose coupling between objects
- When you need to implement a publish-subscribe mechanism
- When you want to implement event handling systems

## When Not to Use

- When the number of observers is fixed and small
- When the update frequency is very high
- When the order of notifications is critical
- When you need to maintain strict synchronization between objects
- When the observers need to know about each other

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Observers Lightweight**: Observers should perform minimal work in their update methods
2. **Use Interface-based Design**: Define clear interfaces for both Subject and Observer
3. **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully in notification methods
4. **Consider Thread Safety**: Ensure thread safety when dealing with concurrent observers
5. **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Prevent observers from modifying the subject during updates
6. **Use Appropriate Data Structures**: Choose efficient data structures for observer management
7. **Document Notification Order**: Clearly document the order of observer notifications
8. **Implement Cleanup**: Provide proper cleanup mechanisms for observer removal

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a subject and observers
subject := NewConcreteSubject()
observerA := NewConcreteObserverA()
observerB := NewConcreteObserverB()

// Register observers
subject.RegisterObserver(observerA)
subject.RegisterObserver(observerB)

// Change state and notify observers
subject.SetState("new state")

// Remove an observer
subject.RemoveObserver(observerA)
```

## Testing

Run the tests using:

```bash
go test -v
```

The test suite includes:

- Testing subject state management
- Testing observer registration and removal
- Testing notification mechanism
- Testing client functionality
- Testing multiple observer types

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Memory Leaks**: Forgetting to remove observers can lead to memory leaks
2. **Performance Issues**: Too many observers or complex update logic can impact performance
3. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access to shared state can cause race conditions
4. **Infinite Loops**: Observers modifying the subject during updates can cause infinite loops
5. **Tight Coupling**: Poor interface design can lead to tight coupling between components
6. **State Inconsistency**: Inconsistent state updates across observers
7. **Notification Order**: Unpredictable notification order can cause issues
8. **Resource Contention**: Multiple observers competing for shared resources

## Related Patterns

- **Mediator**: Can be used to coordinate complex interactions between observers
- **Command**: Can be used to encapsulate observer actions
- **State**: Can be used to manage subject state transitions
- **Strategy**: Can be used to vary observer behavior
- **Template Method**: Can be used to define the skeleton of observer updates
