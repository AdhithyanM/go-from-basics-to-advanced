# Strategy Pattern

The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Key Components

- **Strategy**: Interface that defines the algorithm contract
- **ConcreteStrategy**: Implements the Strategy interface with specific algorithms
- **Context**: Maintains a reference to a Strategy and delegates algorithm execution
- **Client**: Uses the Context to execute different strategies

## Implementation Features

- Clean separation of algorithm implementations
- Runtime algorithm switching
- Encapsulated algorithm logic
- Easy addition of new algorithms
- Type-safe algorithm selection

## Use Cases

- Different variations of an algorithm
- Multiple ways to process data
- Configurable behavior
- Plugin architectures
- Sorting algorithms
- Payment processing methods
- Compression algorithms
- Authentication strategies

## When to Use

- When you need different variants of an algorithm
- When you have a family of similar algorithms
- When an algorithm uses data that clients shouldn't know about
- When a class defines many behaviors through conditionals
- When you need to vary the algorithm at runtime

## When Not to Use

- When the number of algorithms is fixed
- When algorithms rarely change
- When the algorithm variation is minimal
- When the overhead of strategy objects is a concern
- When the context doesn't need to switch strategies

## Best Practices

1. **Strategy Interface Design**

   - Keep the interface focused and cohesive
   - Use meaningful method names
   - Consider input/output parameters carefully
   - Document the expected behavior

2. **Context Management**

   - Keep the context simple
   - Delegate all algorithm work to strategies
   - Provide clear strategy switching methods
   - Consider default strategies

3. **Strategy Implementation**

   - Keep strategies independent
   - Avoid shared state between strategies
   - Make strategies immutable when possible
   - Document algorithm specifics

4. **Testing**
   - Test each strategy independently
   - Test strategy switching
   - Test edge cases for each strategy
   - Test context behavior

## Example Usage

```go
// Create a client with initial strategy
client := NewClient(NewConcreteStrategyA())

// Execute strategy
result := client.ExecuteStrategy("data")
// Output: "Strategy A: data"

// Change strategy at runtime
client.ChangeStrategy(NewConcreteStrategyB())
result = client.ExecuteStrategy("data")
// Output: "Strategy B: data"
```

## Testing

Run the tests using:

```bash
go test -v
```

The test suite includes:

- Testing individual strategies
- Testing strategy switching
- Testing context behavior
- Testing client usage
- Testing dynamic strategy changes

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Strategy Proliferation**

   - Too many strategy interfaces
   - Complex strategy hierarchies
   - Duplicate strategy implementations
   - Poor strategy organization

2. **Context Bloat**

   - Too much logic in context
   - Complex strategy switching
   - Poor strategy lifecycle management
   - Unclear strategy responsibilities

3. **Performance**

   - Strategy object creation overhead
   - Frequent strategy switching
   - Memory usage with many strategies
   - Complex strategy initialization

4. **Maintenance**
   - Difficult to add new strategies
   - Hard to modify existing strategies
   - Poor strategy documentation
   - Unclear strategy selection logic

## Related Patterns

- **State**: Similar structure but for managing state transitions
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object
- **Template Method**: Defines algorithm skeleton in a base class
- **Factory Method**: Creates appropriate strategy objects
- **Bridge**: Separates abstraction from implementation
